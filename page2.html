<li> In this image you see rock painting. This type of craft is easy for it could be done on rainy days and with juts paint and a rock! Its really cute and i assure you kids will lvoe this craft becuase they will be able to tak eit home show their parents and show everyone what they have made and keep it. Rather than other crafts that are made and then lost or thrown away.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
<p> As you can see, any thing can be painted on the rock. This is an advantage becuase kids have a specific thing or things they love and they could choose that and choosing what they want will make them be more satisfied with the craft. </p>
